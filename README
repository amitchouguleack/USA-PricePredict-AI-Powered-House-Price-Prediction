🏡 USA-PricePredict: AI-Powered House Price Estimator
🔍 Project Snapshot
USA-PricePredict is a hands-on machine learning project designed to estimate housing prices across the United States using regression models. It showcases a complete ML pipeline — from data wrangling to model comparison — using a synthetic dataset ideal for experimentation and portfolio demos.

📊 Dataset Overview
The dataset (USA_Housing.csv) includes anonymized, synthetic housing data with features like income, house age, rooms, bedrooms, population, and price. The Address column is dropped during preprocessing.
