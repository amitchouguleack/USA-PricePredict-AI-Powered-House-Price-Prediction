### 🔍 Project Snapshot

USA-PricePredict is a hands-on machine learning project designed to estimate housing prices across the United States using regression models. It showcases a complete ML pipeline — from data wrangling to model comparison — using a synthetic dataset ideal for experimentation and portfolio demos.

---

### 📊 Dataset Overview

The dataset (`USA_Housing.csv`) includes anonymized, synthetic housing data with features like:

- Average Area Income
- Average House Age
- Average Number of Rooms
- Average Number of Bedrooms
- Area Population
- Price (target variable)

The `Address` column is dropped during preprocessing.
